/**
 * @file UniSport Central - Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model for the UniSport Central application.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /sports/{sportId}: Public data about sports.
 * - /venues/{venueId}: Public data about venues.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Public data about events.
 * - /events/{eventId}/teams/{teamId}: Data about teams participating in events.
 * - /events/{eventId}/matches/{matchId}: Data about matches scheduled for events.
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /events/{eventId}/logs/{logId}: Log entries for events.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can read and write their own profile data.
 * - Admins can create, update, and delete sports, venues, and events.
 * - All sports, venues and events are publicly readable.
 * - Teams and Matches are scoped to specific events. Creation, modification, and deletion of teams and matches is not supported and therefore denied.
 *
 * Access Control Patterns:
 * - Sports: Public read, admin write.
 * - Venues: Public read, admin write.
 * - Events: Public read, admin write.
 * - Teams: Event-scoped access.
 * - Matches: Event-scoped access.
 * - Users: Owner-only access.
 * - Logs: Event-scoped access.
